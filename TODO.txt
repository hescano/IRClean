- Improve the way basic connection information is displayed. Instead of showing the information at the top of the screen, an extra form with that information would be more readable.
- Support to send formatted text to the chat, including emoticons.
- Create a form to deal with the badword filter. The form should read the badwords from a file. The format of the file is completely irrelevant (e.g. XML, JSON, CSV, or plain).
- Handle disconnects gracefully.
